Detector Response and Pandora Calibration Procedure 
for detector geometries implemented in DD4hep
-----------------------------------------------


The procedure is based on S. Green's (Cambridge) calibration 
procedure initially developed for ILD using GEAR.


Important Files:

- Calibrate.sh : the main script to start the calibration (needs arguments).
- clean.sh : deletes all produced files and cleans the calibration directory
  (useful to start the calibration from the beginning or for a different model).
